# Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is an arcade game in which the player controls the bird Faby, who is always moving to the right. Faby must be navigated between pairs of pipes with equal-sized holes created at various heights by the user. When the player presses the touchscreen, Faby lowers automatically and only ascends when the player hits the touchscreen again. The player receives one point for each successful pass through a pair of pipes. When you collide with a pipe or the ground, the game is over. The player receives a bronze medal if they score 10 or more points, a silver medal if they score twenty points, a gold medal if they score thirty points, and a platinum medal if they score forty points during the game over screen.
